# MyCode
Welcome to My Code!
My name is Yashas Bhushappagala and this repo is a collection of my code from projects and Machine Problems solved during my time as a Computer Engineering student at UIUC and also fun projects I have built after graduation while exploring new tech stacks and trying to learn as much as I can.
